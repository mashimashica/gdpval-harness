# Needs an active Gym venv, ./env.yaml (copy env.yaml.example) and .env loaded
# into your shell (copy .env.example; this recipe uses HF_TOKEN, NVIDIA_API_KEY,
# JUDGE_API_KEY and TAVILY_API_KEY). Also needs the Apptainer sandbox built by
# build-gdpval-sif.sh, pointed at by GDPVAL_CONTAINER_PATH (see
# instruct/README.md). Run from the Gym repo root — the benchmark's dataset and
# prepare script resolve relative to your working directory. Results land in
# ./results/gdpval.

# Scores each deliverable against its rubric. Comparison mode instead scores against
# reference deliverables you generate yourself, one subdirectory per reference model;
# see instruct/README.md for the layout and how to produce them.
#
# Note: PARALLEL is applied twice on purpose — the agent caps its own concurrent runs
# at 32 regardless of --concurrency, so raising only one of them does nothing.

# Used judges: Gym's default panel — GPT-5.5, Gemini 3.1 Pro and Claude Opus 4.8,
# one sampled per call. All three route through gdpval_judge_model in env.yaml, so
# that endpoint has to serve every one of them.

# JUDGE_ONLY re-scores existing deliverables without running the agent, so it
# needs neither the sandbox nor a search key.
